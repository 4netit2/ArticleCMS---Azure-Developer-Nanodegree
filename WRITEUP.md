# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

I choose App service because:
- development in app service is simpler than VM
- azure virtual machines are more expensive than app service
- even if it has limitations on the hardware side, it was enough for this project

I would have chosen VM if it had been necessary to have more control over the environment or over the OS or installed software on the server. But also due to the fact that I have to pay for the service plan even if the service is not started.
